## Description

>Our vision was to create a useful, intuitive and beautiful booking platform for everyone to use. We’ve made sure that customers can book, employees can work and business owners can take charge. But, we didn’t just want to capture your needs; we wanted to go above and beyond. With a personalised dashboard tailored to each type of user, we’re sure that Nexus Booking Services will meet all your needs AND wants.

This semester-long uni project was part of the 'Software Engineering Process & Tools' course and focused on software engineering principles, Agile methodologies, and software development tools. We worked with ReactJS, Bootstrap, and Charts.js for our front-end technologies, and used Spring Boot and a MySql database for our backend implementation. Unit tests have been written with Enzyme and Jest to work with ReactJS and JUnit was used in tandem with Spring Boot. In terms of deployment, we used CircleCI, Docker and AWS.

Throughout this project, I was primarily the Scrum Master who facilitated the team's daily stand-ups and helped clear development obstacles/hurdles. However, I took on various roles as well to aid the team the best that I could. As a developer, I worked with both the front-end and the back-end. For the front-end, I designed, prototyped and implemented various pages and UIs with a UX focus that was both aesthetic and practical. In terms of back-end development, I aided in the construction of our APIs but mostly focused on completing various comprehensive unit tests and obtaining a high level of code coverage. I was also heavily involved with our Product Owner in defining customer requirements through user stories and customer acceptance criteria, product backlog grooming, and sprint backlog prioritisations.
